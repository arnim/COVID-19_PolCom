# COVID-19 in Germany's Political Discourse


**RQ:** What prevalence does *COVID-19* have in the social media messaging across Germany's political spectrum? 


## Methodology

We measure the number of posts on Twitter created by the parties in the German Bundestag containing the string "corona". We restrict us to the account of the left-wing party *Die Linke* ([@Linksfraktion](https://twitter.com/Linksfraktion)) and the right-wing party *Alternative f√ºr Deutschland* ([@AfDimBundestag](https://twitter.com/AfDimBundestag)). The project is intended for demonstration purposes and has the following materials included.
